# Averages and Proportions

# Property 1:  The expected value of the sum of random variables is the sum of
#                 the expected values of the individual random variables
#                 SE[ X1 + X2 + ... + Xn ] = SE[ X1 ] + SE[ X2 ] + ... + SE[ Xn ]
#                 SE[ X1 + X2 + ... + Xn ] = nu
# Property 2:  The expected value of a random variable times a non-random constant
#                 is the expected value times that non-random constant.
#                 SE[ aX ] = a * E[ X ]
#                 Expected Value of the average is 'u'
# Property 3:  The square of the standard error of the sum of independent random
#                 variables is the sum of the square of the standard error of
#                 each random variable
#                 SE[ x1 + X2 + ... + Xn ] = sqrt( SE[ X1 ]^2 + SE[ X2 ]^2 + ... + SE[ Xn ]^2 )
#                 Variance[ X1 ] = SE[ X1 ]^2
# Property 4:  The standard error of a random variable times a non-random
#                 constant is the standard error times the non-random constant
#                 SE[ aX ] = a x SE[ X ]
# Consequence of these previous two properties is that the standard error of the
#    average of independent draws from the same urn is the standard deviation
#    of the urn - called sigma, divided by the square root of 'n'
#    SE[ X1 + X2 + .... + Xn)/n ]    = sigma / sqrt( n )
# Property 5: If X is a normally distributed random variable, then if 'a' and 'b'
#    are non-random constants, aX + b is also a normally distributed random
#    variable.



# Law of large numbers
# When 'n' is very large, the average of the draws converfes to the average
#    of the urn.  Then the standard error is practically 0, and the average
#    fo the draws converges to the average of the urn.


# The law of averages applies only when the number of draws is very, very large,
#    not in small samples.
